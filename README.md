### Impact-Data-Model-NGO
This Community Sprint project is to explore how we might incorporate impact measurement elements into the Program Management Module and Outbound Funds Module to enable standardized program outcomes and impact data in both.

### Project Vision (Please make this your first task as a team)

* Align around a big picture vision for impact management at scale and the ecosystem's role in realizing it
* Brainstorm many different approaches to realizing that vision
* Prioritize together what could make sense for a community project
* Determine roles and next steps given the scope of the possible project(s)

**2 years from now, what goals do we have?
* Common Arcitecture - In two years time,  we will have a lightweight framework that can  sit on top of/side by side other open source tools to support impact management
* Nonprofit Networks - In 2 years time we have an easy way for orgs to share successful (and unsuccessful) program models
* Making Impact Management Easier - In two years time, nonprofits will have clear step-by-step, in-app guidance for how to create their own impact strategy and data model based on a comprehensive knowledge base of sample tools & frameworks.

### Future Contributions (AKA what were you unable to finish at the Sprint)
Often, it takes multiple Sprints to contribute an idea back into the Community. What happens at a Sprint does not stay at a Sprint! If someone were to contribute to this project at the next Sprint what would you want them to work on to move this project forward?<br>

* What types of team roles does this project require? This gives you a way to tell future volunteers what kinds of tasks you need help with to complete this project. For example: Do you need a developer, documentation writer, qa tester, thought-leader, general volunteers, etc.

* What is your project's Roadmap?
Created working groups to continue to work on sub-projects. Check back for future Wiki Pages and Issues to keep up with the working groups.

### Project Documentation
Where can you project documentation be found? i.e. Wiki? Google drive?

**Important**: If you have specific asks to help move this project forward we would recommend that you list them here, but also create separate Issues for each and add the label of "help wanted". This is a well-worn best practice for projects living in GitHub.
