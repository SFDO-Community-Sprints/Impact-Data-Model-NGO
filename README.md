### Impact-Data-Management-NGO
This Community Sprint project is to explore how we might incorporate impact measurement elements into the Program Management Module and Outbound Funds Module to enable standardized program outcomes and impact data in both.


### Project Theme
Impact Management

### Project Vertical
This project focused on nonprofits - while we are agnostic about the focus of the nonprofits, one key element of this project is to build a lightweight data management infrastructure and the theoretical client for this is small-to-medium nonprofits with limited existing impact management infrastructure.

### Project Vision (Please make this your first task as a team)

* Align around a big picture vision for impact management at scale and the ecosystem's role in realizing it
* Brainstorm many different approaches to realizing that vision
* Prioritize together what could make sense for a community project
* Determine roles and next steps given the scope of the possible project(s)

**2 years from now, what goals do we have?**
* Common Architecture - In two years time,  we will have a lightweight framework that can  sit on top of/side by side other open source tools to support impact management
* Nonprofit Networks - In 2 years time we have an easy way for orgs to share successful (and unsuccessful) program models
* Making Impact Management Easier - In two years time, nonprofits will have clear step-by-step, in-app guidance for how to create their own impact strategy and data model based on a comprehensive knowledge base of sample tools & frameworks.

### Project Team Accomplishments
* [01/04/2021-02/01/2021] We are focusing in on a lightweight solution that will help organizations begin measuring the initial outcomes of their programs. We have opted to focus on small-to-medium direct service nonprofits with limited impact management infrastructure, as the theoretical customer. Over the next few weeks, we'll be conducting interviews with nonprofits that fit this profile to learn more about their approach to evaluation and impact. Questions can be viewed and shared here: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeU0Z2CXGIRbFqxnLzhQn3HtxTnJqm0ZcAf1crj2iBPgWq98w/viewform

* [2020] Developed 2 year Goals, Challenges and 3 sub-teams to tackle the various pieces to help teach Impact Management more broadly across the sector.

### Future Contributions (AKA what were you unable to finish at the Sprint)

* What is your project's Roadmap?
Created working groups to continue to work on sub-projects. 
We’d like to frame the upcoming February sprint around drafting a lightweight data model for impact management. The intent is that this model would be flexible enough so that it can be used in conjunction with other packages and apps. Our goal is not to build an end-to-end solution for impact management - it is to develop a model that could form the base of, and enable interoperability between, a range of impact management solutions. We believe that the end-user for this solution is a small-to-medium sized nonprofit in direct service with limited impact management infrastructure. 
 
Specifically, we hope to come out of the sprint having defined the custom objects, fields, and object relationships that will allow for the collection of data related to indicators of impact.  We aim to design a data model that will build upon or complement other Salesforce.org products such as PMP, Outbound Funds, and VFS, without necessarily depending upon them.
 
If you have worked for, or with, a small to medium sized nonprofit we would especially appreciate your input – no advanced Salesforce expertise required! We want to build a solution that can help meet as many use cases as possible while focusing on the most common scenarios and approaches.
 
If you would like to share your nonprofit’s use case in advance of the sprint, we have set up a form to help collect and build a small library of use cases to design towards. If you would take 15-20 minutes to share with us your org’s current approach to collecting program impact data, it would directly contribute this sprint: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeU0Z2CXGIRbFqxnLzhQn3HtxTnJqm0ZcAf1crj2iBPgWq98w/viewform
